# cryptography
*I am plan to work on several projects vaguely related to cryptography, this is where I'll store them*

The general idea is that with the softwsre that I'll write and store in this repository, I (and anyone else who wants to) will be able to make any form of data very difficult for a 3rd party to read.

**A quote I think is important** "A secure cypher relies only on the key being secret, not on the algorithm being secret." *this* is why I will be publishing all of my code and algorithms, and making them availible as open source software.
