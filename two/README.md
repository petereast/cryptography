*I haven't figured out what to call this yet, but it's going to be cool*

## TODO

- [ ] Create a function to split the input bytes into cubes.
- [x] Create a function to generate a list of cubic numbers based on the length of the original input.
- [ ] Create a set of functions to apply transformations to those cubes.
- [ ] Do all of this while bearing in mind the massive tax this could potentially have on the system memory.
- [x] Write an algorithm to reorder a list based on a key.
