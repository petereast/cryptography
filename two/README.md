# Two
*I haven't figured out what to call this yet, but it's going to be cool*

## TODO

- [ ] Create a function to split the input bytes into cubes.
- [ ] Create a function to generate a random list of cubic numbers.
- [ ] Create a set of functions to apply transformations to those cubes.
- [ ] Do all of this while bearing in mind the massive tax this could potentially have on the system memory.
- [ ] Find a way to reorder a list in a way which is recoverable. (and a way which is better than my current way)
